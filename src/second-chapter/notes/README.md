# Notes about second chapter

Whe you need to storage multiple elements uses an Array or List.

In an array, the elements are ordered and can be accessed by an index. The index starts from 0.
In list, the elements are not ordered and can be accessed by a key, so one element has the address of the other.

Chained lists is more efficient than arrays to remove and insert elements. Array allow fast read and write, but slow to remove and insert elements.

All elements in an array has to be of the same type, to maintain the integrity of the array and the data. If you want multiples types of elements you can use objects.
