### 1.1 - Suppose you have a list with 128 names and you are doing a binary search. What would be the maximum number of steps it would take you to find the name you want?

The answer will be 7 because it is necessary to do a search with the total value and dividing by 2.

$\frac{X} {2} = y$

And y divides by two and so on. So applying the binary search algorithm

> Answer: 7

### 1.2 - Suppose you double the size of the list. What would be the maximum number of stages now?

As the list size has been doubled, 1 more step is added. since the algorithm does a search by dividing the element by 2.
